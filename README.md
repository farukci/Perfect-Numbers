### What is a Perfect Number?
In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number">Wikipedia</a>
